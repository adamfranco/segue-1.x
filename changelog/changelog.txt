    site and can be exported from one instance of Segue to another. This Media
    Library link allows users to easily get urls of Media Library files to
    copy/paste into HTML or text editors. When text content blocks are saved to
    database the $cfg[uploadurl] and $sitename portions of Media Library file urls
    (i.e. entire url except filename) are converted to a placeholder (i.e. unique
    string). When text content blocks are displayed or edited (i.e. fetched from

    url(based on current $cfg[uploadurl] and site name.

    to submit their name and email address when posting to public discussions. Email
    address in user registration UI is checked against email addresses in user
    table. In addition, their is a new config option for specifying emails that
    cannot be registered as visitor (these would be emails address that are set up
    for an institution' users and part of their user account and authentication.
