		(Alex Chapin)

		link to that RSS feed.
		(Alex Chapin)

		well added the RSS icon to the left of the more RSS link for additional RSS
		feeds. 
		(Alex Chapin)
		
	* Change: 
		There has been a problem with inadvertant session-hijacking. This is caused
		when a user (with cookies diabled and the PHP Session ID passed in their
		URL) copy/pastes a Segue url containing the session ID into an email or
		external website. When students (or others click on that link, they are now
		using the session with the id specified in the url. Multiple users clicking
		such a link would all end up using the same session, causing login/logout
		actions of one user to apply to state of all users who clicked that link. As
		there is no technological trick in PHP that would allow the continued
		passing of the Session ID in the URL without this problem, Segue will now
		force the use of cookies for authenticated users.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Change: 
		Changed display of sections with single pages. Specifically, when a section
		has only one page, a sidebar link is still created. (this change undoes a
		new feature introduced in version 1.5 whereby sections with only one page
		would not display a link to that page in the left sidebar). To avoid
		confusion as well as inform users of options, when a section has only one
		page, a note is displayed at the top of the sidebar indicating the section
		has only one page and a link is provided to change the section display
		settings to hide the sidebar.
		(Alex Chapin)
		
	* New feature: 
		Added section display options. Specifically added a display option to hide
		sidebars. When this option is selected, both the left and right sidebars are
		hidden and if the section has more than one page, links are displayed to the
		previous and next pages. If this section setting to hide sidebars is turned
		on, then a note is displayed at the top of each sidebar indicated this and a
		link is provided to change the section display settings to show the sidebar.

		if no attribution or no horizontal rule, then a single space is put between
		content blocks. If horizontal rules specified, then no space is put between
		content blocks.
		(Alex Chapin)		
		
	* Change: 
		The title for image type content blocks now only displayed below the image
		center justified and no longer is displayed above the image. As well, the
		add/edit UI for image type content blocks no longer refers to Title and
		Caption/Description but instead refers to Caption and Description

		such as specifying link target.

	* Change: 
		The 1st page link of any section no longer uses the heading style that was
		introduced in version 1.5
		(Alex Chapin)
		
	* Change: 
		Content blocks without titles display a link to their detail view (i.e.
		unique URL) to the right of attribution and timestamp display (this link
		used to display above attribution display). This means that the url for a
		given content block without a title will be displayed only if
		attribution/timestamp is set to display and/or discussion/assessment is
		enabled and/or there is extended content. (content blocks with titles use
		the title itself as the unique link for that content block)
		(Alex Chapin)
		
	* New feature:

		(Alex Chapin)
		
	* New feature:

		labeled "link" is displayed below the content block above links to
		discussion and attribution.
		(Alex Chapin)
		
	* Change: 
		If the current date is not within the active dates range of a content block
		then the active dates range will be displayed in edit mode and the content

		will not be displayed and a select menu with links to all content blocks on
		the page will be displayed.
		(Alex Chapin)
		
	* Change: 
		Categories have been reimplemented such that a given content block can be
		added to more than one category. Category select UI changed from select menu
		to an alphabetical list of categories that are links that populate the
		category field and that highlighted currently selected categories.
		(Alex Chapin)
		
	* New feature: 
		Added new page type called Participant list. This page type allows users to
		display a list of the names of all participants in the site in the left or
		right sidebar including the Site Owner, Roster participants (for class

		created by a given roster participant, their name will be a link to this
		associated site. The Participant list type does not have children (i.e. do
		not have stories)
		(Alex Chapin)
		
	* New feature: 
		Added new page type called Categories. This page type allows users to

		a line-return and a line break inserted by the editor.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: 
		Sites now only appear once in the 'Copy Site' bar.
		(Adam Franco)

		(Adam Franco)
		
	* New feature:

		saved when added via section and page link types and via story link types.
		Specifically, the full uri portion of internal link urls are replaced with a

		(Alex Chapin)

		configured to have as few or many semesters as desired, each with custom
		start/end days.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	**** IMPORTANT *** Change: 
		The semester-handling changes involve new config options if upgrading from
		Segue 1.2.x or earlier. Change also necessitates a database table change if
		semesters other than w,s,l,f are used. These table changes can be made by
		running the 1.3.0 update under 'admin tools' --&gt; 'updates'
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix: 
		Classes are now ordered by year, semester, and code on the default page.

	* New feature: 
		Added error-printing functions to print out backtraces neatly.

	* New feature: 
		Added Media Library link to text content block UI to allow users to easily
		add media files to text content blocks in a way that is portable across
		copies of a site and can be exported from one instance of Segue to another.
		This Media Library link allows users to easily get urls of Media Library
		files to copy/paste into HTML or text editors. When text content blocks are
		saved to database the $cfg[uploadurl] and $sitename portions of Media
		Library file urls (i.e. entire url except filename) are converted to a
		placeholder (i.e. unique string). When text content blocks are displayed or
		edited (i.e. fetched from database), the url placeholder is converted back
		to actual current media file url (based on current $cfg[uploadurl] and site
		name. 
		(Alex Chapin)
		
	* Bug Fix:

		it is appended at the end of short text as "...more." Have put an anchor on
		title of discuss/assess UI and added reference to this anchor in the
		discuss/assess link.
		(Alex Chapin)
		
	* New feature:

	* New feature: 
		Have added a function in class_functions for getting list of students from
		class groups in Segue tables. Have also added to this function code to get a
		list of students in a given class from LDAP groups. This code appears in
		midd.inc.php and can be used as a reference for other ldap implementations.
		(Alex Chapin)
		
	* New feature: 
		Added student roster listing UI for class type sites. This UI allows site
		owners to add and remove users from their class group. In addition, class
		type sites will list all students in class in discussion moderation UI,
		regardless of whether or not they have posted to discussions/assessments on
		the class site.
		(Alex Chapin)
		
	* New feature: #956123 
		Added visitor and guest usertypes. Visitors can participate in public

	* New feature: #957605 
		Added user registration UI that appears in public discussions when posts are
		made without authentication. User registration UI requires unauthenticated
		users to submit their name and email address when posting to public
		discussions. Email address in user registration UI is checked against email
		addresses in user table. In addition, their is a new config option for
		specifying emails that cannot be registered as visitor (these would be
		emails address that are set up for an institution' users and part of their
		user account and authentication. Segue user accounts are created for users
		who register this way and these users are sent an email with their username
		(=email address) and a auto- generated password. These users are visitor
		usertypes. 
		(Alex Chapin)
		
	* New feature: 
		Added an RSS Feed content type that allows the inclusion of RSS feeds into a
		Segue site.
		(Adam Franco)
		
	* Bug Fix:

	**** IMPORTANT *** Change: 
		The HTMLarea editor works with Mozilla 1.3 beta or higher or Windows
		Internet Explorer 5.5. or higher. This editor doesn't work in Safari or Mac
		Internet Explorer. For these browsers, a standard textarea is available.
		(Alex Chapin)
		
	* New feature: #957602 
		Added UI for discussion/assessment participation summary and moderation.
		This UI gives site owners a list of all the participants in a given
		discussion/assessment or in all the discussions/assessments in the given
