    whichspecify public listing.
		
    * Bug Fix:  (Alex Chapin)

    Added Media Library link to text content block UI to allow users to easily
    add media files to text content blocks in a way that is portable across
    copies of a site and can be exported from one instance of Segue to another.
    This Media Library link allows users to easily get urls of Media Library
    files to copy/paste into HTML or text editors. When text content blocks are
    saved to database the $cfg[uploadurl] and $sitename portions of Media
    Library file urls (i.e. entire url except filename) are converted to a
    placeholder (i.e. unique string). When text content blocks are displayed or
    edited (i.e. fetched from database), the url placeholder is converted back
    to actual current media file url (based on current $cfg[uploadurl] and site

    midd.inc.phpand can be used as a reference for other ldap implementations.

    Added user registration UI that appears in public discussions when posts are
    made without authentication. User registration UI requires unauthenticated
    users to submit their name and email address when posting to public
    discussions. Email address in user registration UI is checked against email
    addresses in user table. In addition, their is a new config option for
    specifying emails that cannot be registered as visitor (these would be
    emails address that are set up for an institution' users and part of their
    user account and authentication. Segue user accounts are created for users
    who register this way and these users are sent an email with their username
