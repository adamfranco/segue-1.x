		</new>
		<change author="alex">
			Changed the way internal links (i.e. links to other pages in same site)
			are saved when added via section and page link types and via story link
			types.  Specifically, the full uri portion of internal link urls are
			replaced with a constant (similiar to Media Library path) when saved

		</change>
		<change author='adam'>
			When Changing to a differnt active user as admin, you are now kept on
			the same page.
		</change>
		<new author='gabe'>

		<change author="adam">
			Changed the way semesters are defined and handled. Segue can now be configured
			to have as few or many semesters as desired, each with custom start/end
			days.
		</change>
		<important author='adam'>
			The semester-handling changes involve new config options if upgrading
			from Segue 1.2.x or earlier. Change also necessitates a database table
			change if semesters other than w,s,l,f are used. These table changes can
			be made by running the 1.3.0 update under 'admin tools' --> 'updates'
		</important>
		<fix author='adam'>

		</fix>
		<new author='adam'>
			Added error-printing functions to print out backtraces neatly.
		</new>
		<new author='alex'>
			Added Media Library link to text content block UI to allow users to easily
			add media files to text content blocks in a way that is portable across copies
			of a site and can be exported from one instance of Segue to another. This
			Media Library link allows users to easily get urls of Media Library files to 
			copy/paste into  HTML or text editors.  When text content blocks are saved to
			database the $cfg[uploadurl] and $sitename portions of Media Library file urls 
			(i.e. entire url except filename) are converted to a placeholder 
			(i.e. unique string).  When text content blocks are displayed or edited 
			(i.e. fetched from database), the url placeholder is converted back to actual 
			current media file url (based on current $cfg[uploadurl] and site name.
		</new>
		<fix author='alex'>

			but instead truncate their display to avoid stretching their enclosing tables.
		</change>
		<change author='alex'>
			Have changed full text link (for content blocks with extended text) so that it
			is appended at the end of short text as "...more."  Have put an anchor on title
			of discuss/assess UI and added reference to this anchor in the discuss/assess 
			link.
		</change>
		<new author='alex'>
			Have added an option to chose a discuss/assess link label.  Choses are: discuss,
			assess, comment, review and register.
		</new>
		<change author='alex'>
			Have moved code in add_student.php that gets lists of students in class groups 
			to new getclassstudents function in class_functions/empty.inc.php.
		</change>
		<new author='alex'>
			Have added a function in class_functions for getting list of students from 
			class groups in Segue tables. Have also added to this function code to get a list of 
			students in a given class from LDAP groups.  This code appears in midd.inc.php
			and can be used as a reference for other ldap implementations.  
		</new>
		<new author='alex'>
			Added student roster listing UI for class type sites.  This UI allows site
			owners to add and remove users from their class group.  In addition, class 
			type sites will list all students in class in discussion moderation UI,
			regardless of whether or not they have posted to discussions/assessments on the 
			class site.
		</new>
		<new author='alex' ref='956123' reftype='fr'>
			Added visitor and guest usertypes.  Visitors can participate in public
			discussions and can be assigned permissions.  Visitors cannot view

			accessible to institute users and can view institute-only content.  Neither
			visitors nor guests are given a slot for a personal site.

			Segue's db 2. registering new visitor type users 3. Log in of existing users.
		</change>
		<new author='alex' ref='957605' reftype='fr'>
			Added user registration UI that appears in public discussions when posts
			are made without authentication.  User registration UI requires unauthenticated
			users to submit their name and email address when posting to public discussions.
			Email address in user registration UI is checked against email addresses in 
			user table.  In addition, their is a new config option for specifying emails
			that cannot be registered as visitor (these would be emails address that are 
			set up for an institution' users and part of their user account and authentication.
			Segue user accounts are created for users who register this way and
			these users are sent an email with their username (=email address) and a auto-
			generated password.  These users are visitor usertypes. 
		</new>
		<new author='adam'>
			Added an RSS Feed content type that allows the inclusion of RSS feeds into
			a Segue site.

			This UI gives site owners a list of all the participants in a given
