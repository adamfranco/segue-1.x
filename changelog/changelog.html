		<li/><span style="color: red">*** IMPORTANT ***</span> Change:  
			Various changes in Segue necessitate that you upgrade to a new config
			file as well as run the '1.3.0 update' under 'admin tools' --&gt; 'updates'
			to make several changes to Segue's database and file-storage structure.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		
		<li/> Bug Fix:
	 
			Sites associated with a class and class sites now can properly
			add the class as an editor.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> Bug Fix:
	 
			Segue now prints a nice error instructing the user to update thier links 
			if a bad link tries to get a non-existant section or page and creates a 
			corrupted section or page object.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			When copying a site, section, or page, links internal to that part 
			(such as links in a	content block that point to another page in the 
			site or section) are now updated to point to the appropriate place in 
			the new version of the part.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> Bug Fix:
	 
			When editing slots, information about whether the slot was in use not or not
			is now accurate.
		 (<i>Alex Chapin</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			Added new template to config.inc.php.
		 (<i>Alex Chapin</i>)		
		<li/> Change:  
			Changed display of links on home page.  In particular, change &quot;Public Site
			Lising&quot; to &quot;Public Sites&quot;.  Removed &quot;links&quot; header and removed header
			formatting from help link.  Also added text to public site listing.
		 (<i>Alex Chapin</i>)		
		<li/> New feature:  
			Added a config option to include forgot your password link below login
			fields when there has been no authentication.  This allows users to request
			Segue to reset the passwords for their Segue user accounts (i.e. those 
			accounts whose authentication type is &quot;db&quot;)
		 (<i>Alex Chapin</i>)		
		<li/> Bug Fix:
	 
			HTMLAREA and plaintext box editing now behavies better with respect to
			line returns. HTMLArea submissions now have the first line return removed
			to prevent them from accumulating. Plain textarea line returns are converted
			to &lt;br /&gt; tags.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			Discussions now display 'cancel' buttons when in post or rate modes.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			Added 'Preview as user' functionality (found in the Permissions screen)
			that allows the owner of a site to see what the site would look like for
			other users (including 'everyone' and 'institute'). This can give site
			owners a better understanding of the permissions system.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			Added Your Posts link to home page (default.inc.php).  Your posts displays
			all discussion/assessment posts the current user has made on all sites.
			Administrators will have the option to view all discussion/assessment posts
			across all sites for all users or find all the posts of a given user.
		 (<i>Alex Chapin</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			Changed the way internal links (i.e. links to other pages in same site)
			are saved when added via section and page link types and via story link
			types.  Specifically, the full uri portion of internal link urls are
			replaced with a constant (similiar to Media Library path) when saved
			to database.  This will allow for updating these links correctly when
			copying a site or moving a site from one instance of Segue to another.
		 (<i>Alex Chapin</i>)		
		<li/> Change:  
			Changed Active-X editor so that it links to the Media Library for images.
		 (<i>Alex Chapin</i>)		
		<li/> Change: <a href="&#10;        				http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=865093&amp;group_id=82171&amp;atid=565234">
        			#865093</a> 
			View and activate permission settings on template sites now affect
			who/when they appear for users creating sites.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			Added the HTML Area editor to Image, Link, and File, story types.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> Bug Fix:
	 
			Fixed bug in display of stories by enclosing each story in a table to
			prevent edit and discuss/assess links from shifting across stories
		 (<i>Alex Chapin</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			When logging in and logging out, users are kept on the same page if
			possible instead of being redirected back to the default page.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			The 'Site not availible' error is now more informative and includes
			links to &quot;Home&quot; as well as a &quot;create site&quot; link if the active user
			is allowed to create a site in that place. The latter is useful when
			taking advantage of the vhost functionality.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			When Changing to a differnt active user as admin, you are now kept on
			the same page.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			Segue can now be configured to restrict users to given sites based
			on the virtual host asked for. Each vhost must be set up on the webserver
			as well as in the Segue config.
		 (<i>Gabe Schine</i>)
		<li/> Bug Fix:
	 
			stripped html tags from of first 25 characters of content that is the topic
			of discussion and is displayed in discussion/assessment participation summary.
		 (<i>Alex Chapin</i>)
		<li/> Change:

			to have as few or many semesters as desired, each with custom start/end
			days.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/><span style="color: red">*** IMPORTANT ***</span> Change:  
			The semester-handling changes involve new config options if upgrading
			from Segue 1.2.x or earlier. Change also necessitates a database table
			change if semesters other than w,s,l,f are used. These table changes can
			be made by running the 1.3.0 update under 'admin tools' --&gt; 'updates'
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> Bug Fix:
	 
			Classes are now ordered by year, semester, and code on the default page.

			sites.php now queries the new (as of a year ago) tables when checking
			for the type of a site.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)

			is &quot;no rating&quot;.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> Bug Fix:

		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			Added error-printing functions to print out backtraces neatly.

		<li/> New feature:  
			Added Media Library link to text content block UI to allow users to easily
			add media files to text content blocks in a way that is portable across copies
			of a site and can be exported from one instance of Segue to another. This
			Media Library link allows users to easily get urls of Media Library files to 
			copy/paste into  HTML or text editors.  When text content blocks are saved to
			database the $cfg[uploadurl] and $sitename portions of Media Library file urls 
			(i.e. entire url except filename) are converted to a placeholder 
			(i.e. unique string).  When text content blocks are displayed or edited 
			(i.e. fetched from database), the url placeholder is converted back to actual 
			current media file url (based on current $cfg[uploadurl] and site name.
		 (<i>Alex Chapin</i>)
		<li/> Bug Fix:
	 
			Fixed bug in media library (filebrowser.php) that prevented getting custom
			upload limits when called from add content block UI (add_story_form_1_item.inc)
		 (<i>Alex Chapin</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			Link type pages no longer open in new window.
		 (<i>Alex Chapin</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			Link type content blocks no longer print out urls greater than 70 characters
			but instead truncate their display to avoid stretching their enclosing tables.
		 (<i>Alex Chapin</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			Have changed full text link (for content blocks with extended text) so that it
			is appended at the end of short text as &quot;...more.&quot;  Have put an anchor on title
			of discuss/assess UI and added reference to this anchor in the discuss/assess 
			link.
		 (<i>Alex Chapin</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			Have added an option to chose a discuss/assess link label.  Choses are: discuss,
			assess, comment, review and register.
		 (<i>Alex Chapin</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			Have moved code in add_student.php that gets lists of students in class groups 
			to new getclassstudents function in class_functions/empty.inc.php.
		 (<i>Alex Chapin</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			Have added a function in class_functions for getting list of students from 
			class groups in Segue tables. Have also added to this function code to get a list of 
			students in a given class from LDAP groups.  This code appears in midd.inc.php
			and can be used as a reference for other ldap implementations.  
		 (<i>Alex Chapin</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			Added student roster listing UI for class type sites.  This UI allows site
			owners to add and remove users from their class group.  In addition, class 
			type sites will list all students in class in discussion moderation UI,
			regardless of whether or not they have posted to discussions/assessments on the 
			class site.
		 (<i>Alex Chapin</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			Added visitor and guest usertypes.  Visitors can participate in public
			discussions and can be assigned permissions.  Visitors cannot view 
			institute-only content and are not given a slot for a personal site.
			Guests can participate in all discussions/assessments accessible to 
			institute users and can view institute-only content.  In addition, guests
			are given a slot for a personal site.
		 (<i>Alex Chapin</i>)
		<li/> Change:  
			Changed passwd.php to handle 1. changing passwords of users authenticated via
			Segue's db 2. registering new visitor type users 3. Log in of existing users.
		 (<i>Alex Chapin</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			Added user registration UI that appears in public discussions when posts
			are made without authentication.  User registration UI requires unauthenticated
			users to submit their name and email address when posting to public discussions.
			Email address in user registration UI is checked against email addresses in 
			user table.  In addition, their is a new config option for specifying emails
			that cannot be registered as visitor (these would be emails address that are 
			set up for an institution' users and part of their user account and authentication.
			Segue user accounts are created for users who register this way and
			these users are sent an email with their username (=email address) and a auto-
			generated password.  These users are visitor usertypes. 
		 (<i>Alex Chapin</i>)
		<li/> New feature:  
			Added an RSS Feed content type that allows the inclusion of RSS feeds into
			a Segue site.
		 (<i>Adam Franco</i>)
		<li/> Bug Fix:

			more understandable and commented, as well as having less redundency.
			Also, they now support the visitor user-type.
