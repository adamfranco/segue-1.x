			Added file upload UI to discussion/assessment post form.  This feature will allow
			those who post to a discussion to attach a file.  Upload UI uses the site 
			Media Library (accessible from filebrowser.php).  When the Media Library is
			accessed from discussion/assessment, only files uploaded by the currently authenticated
			user will appear (unless that user is the site owner).  This new functionality will
			allow the discussion/assessment UI to function as an assignment/assessment dropbox.
