INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR
	Segue 1.0-beta
	released: Feb 26, 2003

BEFORE YOU BEGIN:

You will need a *nix type system running apache with php4 (preferrably 4.3.x) and mysql support.
PHP Options:
	gpc_magic_quotes should be ON
	register_globals should be OFF (for security reasons) but can be on, if you want


STEPS

1) Obtain the segue code.
2) Somewhere in your website, extract the archive: tar zxvf segue1.0-beta.tar.gz
3) cd into the segue directory: cd segue
4) In your MySQL server, create a database for segue and a user that has control of that databse.
5) Execute the db_structure_mysql.txt sql commands on the database. This will create the tables.
6) cd into the configs directory: cd configs
7) copy the config_sample.inc.php file to config_YOURSERVERNAME.inc.php: cp config_sample.inc.php config_YOURSERVERNAME.inc.php
8) edit config_YOURSERVERNAME.inc.php to fit your needs and environment
9) cd back into the segue directory: cd ..
10) type echo "YOURSERVERNAME" > machine
	this tells segue which config file to use
11) Now, whereever you specified your userfiles dir to be in the config file, create that directory:
	mkdir segue_userfiles
	chmod 777 segue_userfiles

		or
	chown www-user segue_userfiles

	Segue *must* have write permissions to this directory

12) An admin user is created automatically: login: admin, password: changethis
