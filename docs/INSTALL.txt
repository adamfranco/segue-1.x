Thank you for using Segue! The following steps should get you up and running:

REQUIREMENTS
-----------------------------------
Segue will run on any *NIX type system. Windows has not been tested.
The following services are required:

1) A web server (preferrably Apache)
2) PHP > 4.3.0
3) a MySQL server > 4.1.22

PHP configuration:
1) register_globals must be ON due to a session-related bug in PHP4 in how it handles
variable references.
2) gpc_magic_quotes should be ON


STEP 1
-----------------------------------
Obtain the Segue source code from:

	http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=82171


STEP 2
-----------------------------------
Untar/gzip the source archive:

	tar zxvf segue-X.X.X.tar.gz
	
Move the "segue" directory to your webspace: (ex.)

	mv segue /your/www/dir
	
	
STEP 3
-----------------------------------
Change to the segue directory, create a copy of the sample config:

	cd /your/www/dir/segue
	cp config_sample.inc.php config.inc.php
					
Edit config.inc.php to match the requirements of your system/institution.


STEP 4
-----------------------------------
In your MySQL server, create a database (we recommend calling it "segue") and a user
with full access to this database.

Tables & other startup information will be inserted automatically.

STEP 5
-----------------------------------
Create the userfiles directory:

	mkdir <userfiles>
	chmod 700 <userfiles>
	
<userfiles> refers to the location of the userfiles directory set in config.inc.php 
(must be part of your webspace). Set the userfiles directory to be read/write/listable 
only by the Apache webserver to help prevent secu


STEP 6
-----------------------------------
Log into your new Segue system: Enter the Segue address into your browser. You should
see the Segue welcome page. If an error appears, check your configuration, or, if the
error persists, report a BUG!

An admin account is created automatically with username: admin, password: changeme
Take a hint and change the password when you log in.

STEP 7 - Additional security
-----------------------------------
By default as of version 1.3.6 Segue now blocks the upload of all
common scripting files in addition to php, php3, and php4. In your config you can
specify additional file extensions to block or allow based on either a whitelist
or a blacklist.

After Segue has had a chance to create its tables, you can remove update and
delete permission for the Segue database user on the log table. This can help
prevent access logs from being modified should Apache become compromised by an
intrusion.
