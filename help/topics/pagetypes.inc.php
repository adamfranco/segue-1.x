<? $title = "Navigation Types (Page)"; ?>

<div class=desc><b>Content Page</b> - will allow you to add content to your site, along with user discussions if necessary.</div>
<div class=desc><b>Link/URL</b> - is a link to a page outside of your site (like <i>http://www.middlebury.edu/</i>). URLs will open in a new window, allowing users to continue browsing your site.</div>
<div class=desc><b>Heading</b> - appears in the navigation area, but with no link attached. It is useful to categorize your pages or links. Organization is sometimes a good thing.</div>
<div class=desc><b>Divider</b> - will put some sort of dividing space between items in your navigation list. This may just be some white space, or a thin line, depending on what theme you chose for your site.</div>
