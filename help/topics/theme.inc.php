<p>Themes are Segue's way of letting you make your site look the way you want it to. By choosing a theme, you can change the entire look and feel of your site. To try themes out, choose a theme from the list and click the thumbnail to preview selected theme.

<p> Some themes have "Theme Settings".  After you select the theme, you are given the option of changing theme settings such as color, for that theme.

<p>Themes can be changed at any time, so if you try one out and want to change to another at any point, you can do so by editing your site settings. The entire content of your site and all other settings will be preserved.

<p><b>Pop up Blocker</b></p>
<p>In order to properly edit Segue themes you must configure you Pop up Blocker to allow pop up windows from Segue.
You can do this as follows:<br />
<ul>
	<li>Mozilla: 1. Chose Tools > Popup Manager 2. Chose to Allow Popups from this site.</li>
	<li>Safari: Deselect Safari > Block Pop-up Windows (Note: Safari does not support Segue's WYSIWYG HTML Editor)</li>
	<li>Internet Explorer: Chose to allow popups from this site for whatever Popup blocker software you have chosen to use.</li>
</ul>
