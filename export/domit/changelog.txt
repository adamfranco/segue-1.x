Version 0.11 (2003/12/22)
- updated to SAXY version 0.1

Version 0.2 (2004/01/15)
- added methods: saveXML, saveTextToFile, loadXML, loadTextFromFile, parsedBy, getElementsByPath
- fixed Expat misbehavior with whitespace handling, where in some versions of PHP and Expat, setting XML_OPTION_SKIP_WHITE has no effect

Version 0.3 (2004/01/21)
- added methods: getNodesByNodeName, getNodesByNodeValue, getText
- updated getTextFromFile and saveTextToFile, which now use file_get_contents and file_put_contents when available
- fixed error in documentation for replaceChild method

Version 0.4 (2004/01/26)
- added methods to class DOMIT_Element: getAttribute, setAttribute, removeAttribute, hasAttribute
- updated documentation and DOMIT! Tutorial
- fixed bug in SAXY where attributes demarcated by single quotes were ignored.

Version 0.41 (2004/01/27)
- fixed bug in parseAttributes method of SAXY. It is now permissible to have equal signs and tabs within attributes.

Version 0.5 (2004/01/28)
- DOMIT_Parser (and SAXY) now preserve CDATASection Nodes when parsing an xml string.
- getNamedElement method of DOMIT_Node was renamed to getNamedElements
- getElementsByTagName now a method of DOMIT_Element in addition to DOMIT_Document
- can pass "*" to getElementsByTagName to return all elements
- getElementsByPath has been completely rewritten to be recursive, and optimized significantly
- added a NodeList class and a NamedNodeMap class
- getElementsByTagName, getNodesByNodeName, and getNodesByNodeValue now return DOMIT_NodeLists instead of arrays

Version 0.51 (2004/01/30)
- updated SAXY parser to correct version, which handles new CDATA parsing functionality

Version 0.52 (2004/02/03)
- fixed a bug in the DOMIT_NodeList class, in which appendNode and removeNode were returning a shallow copy of DOMIT_Node
- added tutorial: "OOP Techniques for Modifying an XML Document: Part 1"
- minor revisions to the DOMIT! Tutorial

Version 0.6 (2004/02/06)
- DOMIT! is far better optimized for speed
- rewrote UIDGenerator class so that uniqid() was no longer being called. This function was causing performance degradation on all systems, and causing Celeron processors to choke badly.
- in class DOMIT_GetElementsByPath, replaced a number of substr calls which returned a single character with $text{integer} syntax, for reduced access time.
- in class DOMIT_GetElementsByPath, replaced several if-else conditionals with case statements to increase performance
- updated to SAXY 0.6, which replaced a number of substr calls with $text{integer} syntax, for reduced access time. 

Version 0.7 (2004/02/25)
- DOMIT! has undergone a number of substantial architectural changes and is almost fully DOM Level 1 compliant. One of its primary goals has been achieved: no XML input is ever discarded by the parser unless requested by the user.
- DOMT_Attr class added. Attributes are now nodes in a NamedNodeMap rather than array elements.
- DOMIT_Comment class added for handling XML comments
- DOMIT_ProcessingInstruction class added for handling ProcessingInstruction nodes
- DOMIT_DocumentFragment class added to allow unstructured collections of nodes to be added to a DOMIT_Document
- DOMIT_CharacterData interface implemented, which enables the convenient manipulation of data text nodes 
- DOMIT_DOMImplementation class added
- DOMIT_DOMException class added. Error-handling now more closely conforms to the DOM spec
- DOMIT_Cache class added. This is a simple yet effective caching mechanism for DOMIT! documents. 
- DOMIT_ChildNodes_Interface class added, which handles the inheritance of appendChild, insertBefore, removeChild, and replaceChild methods
- when Expat is specified as the active parser, and it is not found, DOMIT! will default to the SAXY parser so that no errors occur
- getVersion method added to DOMIT_Document, which returns the current version of DOMIT!
- setDocumentElement method added to DOMIT_Document class, to ensure safe setting of documentElement property
- doctype and xml declaration now preserved.
- Expat parsing now preserves CDATASections, as well as all other nodes preserved by SAXY.
- createAttribute, createDocumentFragment, createComment, createProcessingInstruction, and getDOMImplementation methods added to DOMIT_Document
- splitText function added to DOMIT_TextNode
- getTagName and normalize methods added to DOMIT_Element
- putDataToFile and getDatFromFile methods added to DOMIT_Utilities class
- toString and cloneNode methods added to DOMIT_NodeList and DOMIT_NamedNodeMap classes
- DOMIT! documentation and DOMIT! Tutorial updated

Version 0.8 (2004/03/08)
- type checking added to appendChild, replaceChild, removeChild, and insertBefore methods to ensure that only valid nodes are handled
- createClone method removed from all subclasses of DOMIT_Node and replaced with a properly functioning cloneNode method. (thanks to Brad Parks for bug report)
- the XML Prolog is now parsed properly. Processing Instructions, Comments, DocumentElement, and DocumentType nodes can all be appended as children of a DOMIT_Document. DOMIT_Document->firstChild no longer defaults to the documentElement (thanks to Erik Fleischer for bug report, smaple code, and testing)
- DocumentType node partially implemented
- xmlDeclaration property of DOMIT_Document now properly refers to a DOMIT_ProcessingInstruction node, rather than a string.
- childCount property added to keep track of the number of childNodes of a node.  (thanks to Andrew Eddie for benchmarking and code)
- toNormalizedString method now formats output in a more standard manner (thanks to Tilman Koschnick for code)
- loadXML_utf8, parseXML_utf8, and saveXML_utf8 methods added to simplify handling of non-ASCII characters
- printUTF8Header method added to DOMIT_Utilities, which informs the browser that content is to be interpreted as UTF-8 encoded text
- saveXML (and saveXML_utf8) now has a second parameter, $normalized, which when set to true will save the xml document with toNormalizedString formatting (thanks to Tilman Koschnick for code)
- forHTML method added to DOMIT_Utilities, which wraps text using "<pre>" tags and applies htmlentites() function.
- DOMIT! documentation and DOMIT! Tutorial updated

Version 0.9 (2004/03/20)
- htmlSafe parameter added to toString() and toNormalizedString() methods, which allows an html formatted string output (thanks to Andrew Eddie for suggestion)
- bugs fixed in CDataSection parsing and DocType parsing (thanks to Tilman Koschnick and to deezaster for bug reports)
- removed all use of PHP is_a() function, for better backwards compatibility (thanks to Tilman Koschnick for bug report)
- DOMIT_NamedNodeMaps class subclassed to DOMIT_NamedNodeMaps_Attr, and toArray() method added. Attributes are now a member of this class, and toArray() returns an associative array of attribute name / attribute value pairs for easy iteration over collection (thanks to Brad Parks and Andrew Eddie for suggestions).
- toArray() method added to all Node classes.
- DOMIT! Lite and SAXY Lite included in distribution. This fork is optimized for speed and does not handle parsing of the xml prolog, processing instructions, comments, document fragments, and some other items) 
- new DOMIT testing suite, domit_testing.php, included in distribution (also available online at http://www.engageinteractive.com/domit/testing_domit.php )
