 - Instructions for backing up Segue via the export/import scripts.

Problem:
A problem arrises when the restoration of the database from backup
after a server failure results in a corrupt or missing site. This corruption
may go unnoticed for some time while other sites are edited/added to the
database. Restoring this site from a database dump (and ensuring valid keys)
would be a time-consuming job.

Solution:
It is recommended that database backups be done in conjunction with these XML 
backups.  Exporting sites to XML files which preserve the relationships between
elements without the use of keys allows restoration of individual sites with
new, valid, key linkages and much automation.

===========================
 Exporting one site to XML
===========================
Individual sites can be exported as an XML file and subdirectory of media files
using the export_site.php script. This script takes the name of the site that is
desired to be exported as well as an existing output directory. Ex:

	[root@localhost export]# php export_site.php template01 /backups/segue/

Be sure to run this script as a user who has permission to access the Segue 
media directory or media files will not be copied. For more help, run:

	[root@localhost export]# php export_site.php -h


============================
 Exporting all sites to XML
============================
More often than one site, you will probably want to export all Segue sites on a
regular basis. To accomplish this, use the export_all_sites.php script. This
script takes an existing output directory as a parameter. Ex:

	[root@localhost export]# php export_all_sites.php /backups/segue/

Be sure to run this script as a user who has permission to access the Segue 
media directory or media files will not be copied. If you would rather have a 
compressed archive put in the output directory, use the "-z", compress, option.

	[root@localhost export]# php export_all_sites.php -z /backups/segue/

The "-z" option will export sites to /tmp/segue_tmp/, then create a allsites.tar.gz 
file in <output directory>. This option requires the ability to execute a command 
of the form "tar -czf /backups/segue/allsites.tar.gz /tmp/segue_tmp/". 
For more help, run:

	[root@localhost export]# php export_site.php -h


===========================
 Importing a site from XML
===========================
Individual sites can be imported into Segue from an XML file and directory of 
media files. This can be used to restore a corrupted or deleted site from an 
XML backup. There are several expectations that the import script has of the 
XML file:

 - All users refered to in the XML file exist in the destination Segue instance.
 - All [media] files refered to in the XML exist in the specified source
   directory.
 - The site does not exist in the destination Segue instance.
 
The goal for the initial implementation of these scripts was to support backups
and restoration of sites upon user request. The storage of user, group and
class information necessary for accurate user restoration is beyond the scope
of this goal. If users don't/can't exist in the destination Segue, remove
references to them in the XML file if you still wish to import the site.

If media files do not exist in the source directory, the script with fail with
notices. Either put the files in the directory or remove references to them in
the XML file. The script will not guess which is appropriate.

This script will not overwrite existing sites. Please delete the existing site
first before importing.

Assuming the above conditions are met, import the site with a command such as the
following:

	[root@localhost export]# php import_site.php apache apache \
	/backups/segue/template01/template01.xml /backups/segue/template01/media/

For more help, run:
	
	[root@localhost export]# php import_site.php -h
